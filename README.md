# wslexec

- Refrenced code from: [HanabishiRecca/WslShortcut](https://github.com/HanabishiRecca/WslShortcut)

Run wsl commands directly from windows, supports basic path translation.
Usage:
	- Rename the executable to any name and you can run the coresponding command in WSL.
	- Symbolic link also works.
